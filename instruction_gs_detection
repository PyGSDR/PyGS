#Instruction for GS detection (GSD)
Here is a step-by-step instruction for the Grad-Shafranov-based detection. 

rootDir = '/home/ychen/Desktop/PyGS/'
shockList = rootDir + 'IPShock_ACE_or_WIND_or_Ulysses_1996_2016_DF.p' 
detection(rootDir,spacecraftID='PSP',
    timeStart=datetime(2018,10,31,18,0,0),
    timeEnd=datetime(2018,10,31,20,0,0),
    duration=(10,30),
    includeTe=True,includeNe=True,
    Search=True,CombineRawResult=True,GetMoreInfo=True,
    LabelFluxRope=True,B_mag_threshold=25.0,
    shockList_DF_path=shockList,
    allowIntvOverlap=False)

The main function is the above detection(...), 
which is the only function that needs to run for GSR.    
In addition, one has to specify the directory of 'rootDir' and the source
of shock list.

The following describes each controller/parameter inside this function.    
rootDir: set a directory where you would like to save files, 
such as downloaded & preprocessed data, GS reconstructed figures, etc.
e.g., rootDir = '/Users/Tom_and_Jerry/' 

spacecraftID: specify the spacecraft ID, e.g., 'WIND', 'ACE', 'ULYSSES','PSP','SOLARORBITER' 
e.g., spacecraftID='WIND'

timeStart & timeEnd: specify time of searching interval.
**Better less than a half day.

duration: specify the duration range for detection.
E.g., duration=(10,30), 10 is the lower limit, and 30 is upper limit.
During detection, it will be spilt into (10, 20) & (20, 30), or split
with increments 10/20/40 points.
The lower limit is 10, and the upper limit is 360.

includeTe: include the electron temperature in the transverse pressure Pt'.

includeNe: include the electron number density in the transverse pressure Pt'.

Search: default setting is True to search flux ropes in all 
search windows. Can be set to False if already have a raw result from search.
In such a case, a raw pickle file will be loaded.

CombineRawResult: default setting is True to combine results via all 
search windows. Can be set to False if already have a combined result.
In such a case, a combined pickle file will be loaded.

GetMoreInfo: default setting is True to calculate the average parameters, etc., 
within flux rope interval. Can be set to False if already have detailed info.
In such a case, a detailed info pickle file will be loaded.

LabelFluxRope: set to True if want to label flux rope in the final 
time-series plot

B_mag_threshold: set a limit on the magnitude of the magnetic field to remove
small fluctuations.
  
shockList_DF_path: indicate the shock file to remove flux rope records
containing shocks

allowIntvOverlap: set to True if allow flux rope intervals to be overlapped
with adjacent events
